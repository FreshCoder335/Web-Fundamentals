    <h2>Jeremiah Powell</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jeremiah Powell and I am currently very excited to begin my computer science major.
        This is my first semester here and I have come from a background of loving computers and technology 
        at an early age. I am from Rigby Idaho and have a great family there too. I am looking forward to this 
        semester and am ready to learn many things. I am happy to be here!
    </p>
    <p>I am also an advocate video game player and it is things like this that have really spraked my love for 
        coding and anything computer. My plan is indeed to get more typical coding jobs and that is what I am shooting
        for but I will also be able to go into game design if I so please. That is the beauty of coding and I look forward 
        to it and all the things I can do.
    </p>
