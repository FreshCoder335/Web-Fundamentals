      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever thought about building a gaming pc? 
        You see in online places like twitch and Youtube where people have these fancy computers with real bright LEDs and liquid pumps with glowing tubes and you are just thinking: 
        Where could I get one of those or better yet build one? Well do I have a solution for you. I have built a gaming PC before and tracking down parts can be a hassle, 
        which is why I am prepping a website that allows you to research and compare all the best parts to be able to build your very own.
         All in the same place without having to hunt between pages or even other websites. What do you think?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this particular site is for both gamers and would be streamers alike. Anyone who 
        is in need of a PC or PC parts then this site is for you. PC gaming is indeed a very populated community and it is 
        difficult to find all the right parts to a PC and what goes with what. I aim to fix that issue with this site.
